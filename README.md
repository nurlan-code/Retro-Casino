- About: `about.html`
- Contact: `contact.html`
- Privacy Policy: `privacy.html`
- Terms of Service: `terms.html`

## How to Run
Open `index.html` in a modern browser. All assets are inline; no build step is required.

## Highlights
- Responsive neon‑retro UI (80s vibe)
- Simple slot demo on Home
- Accessible navigation and focus styles
- Consistent header/footer across pages
- Contact form with client‑side toast and reset

## Development Notes
- Each page contains its own scoped CSS and small JS at the bottom for fast load.
