# Retro Casino (Project 5)

Multi-page, retro-styled social casino demo. Built with HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript. No real money, just entertainment.

## Pages
- `index.html` — Home: hero, slot demo, stats, top players, latest updates, and quick game cards
- `games.html` — Games: Coming Soon placeholder
- `features.html` — Features: highlights and FAQ
- `about.html` — About: project + developer info and FAQ
- `contact.html` — Contact: contact form, quick info, FAQ

Each page embeds its own CSS and JS for easy portability (no external bundling needed).

## How to Run
1. Download or clone this folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (double click or drag into a tab).
3. Navigate via the top navigation bar.

No build steps. No dependencies.

## Notes
- Mobile menu works on small screens (☰ button).
- Slot machine on Home is a simple, client-side demo with basic win checks.
- Content is intentionally retro: neon gradients, pixel-ish fonts, and simple animations.
- This is a social casino demo. It does not accept deposits or provide withdrawals.
